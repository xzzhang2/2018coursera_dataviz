# 2018coursera_dataviz
 - This repo stores my assignment-based demonstration of an online course about data viz offered by UIUC via Coursera. 
 - Most of the projects were completed in Apr 2018, if not earlier. 
 - These demonstrations are created for educational purpose and for self-practice. All the datasets are from public domain; whereas the codes are referenced.
